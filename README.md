# Spice-up
Create simple and beautiful presentations

Based upon [SpiceOfDesign's presentation concept](http://spiceofdesign.deviantart.com/art/New-Presentation-Concept-401767854), the goal with this project is to create a presentation app that has everything you need to create simple and beautiful presentations 

## Current Status
At this moment, the app should be considered in an **ALPHA** state. But things are starting to come up together!

### What works:
- The Canvas! You can add and remove Text and Color items, move them around and resize them!
- Multiple Slides. A presentation usually needs more than one slide... Well you can have more slides now!
- Saving and loading... Because it's kind of important
- Image Item. Because having images in your presentation is cool
- Presentation Mode.

### Things to do
- More properties for Text, Shapes and Images
- Pre-defined layouts
- Animations
- And much more!

### How to try it out
So.... You're feeling brave enough to try it out, even on it's **ALPHA** state? Alright then! Good luck!

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install spice-up
```

This PPA should give you regular upgrades every time there is a new commit. In other words: ITâ€™S UNSTABLE
