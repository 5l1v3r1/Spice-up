# Spice-up
Create simple and beautiful presentations

Based upon [SpiceOfDesign's presentation concept](http://spiceofdesign.deviantart.com/art/New-Presentation-Concept-401767854), the goal with this project is to create a presentation app that has everything you need to create simple and beautiful presentations 

## Current Status
At this moment, the app should be considered in **ALPHA**. But things are starting to come up together!

### What works:
- The Canvas! You can add and remove Text and Color items, move them around and resize them!
- Multiple Slides. A presentation usually needs more than one slide... Well you can have more slides now!

### Things to do
- Saving and loading... Because it's kind of important
- Image Item. Because having images in your presentation is cool
- Presentation Mode. You can access it now, but you can't leave or move to the next slide.
- More properties for Text, and Shapes
- Pre-defined layouts
- Animations
- And much more!
